# Dynamics Contact Center Guides

The repository includes a variety of guides aimed at developers and administrators who are using Dynamics Contact Center with Copilot Studio and Power Automate Flows. Iâ€™m documenting my work experience with the product and uploading it here, prior to determining whether these documents will be transferred to learn.microsoft.com.
